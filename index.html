          <p>
            Udacity, Inc. is an American for-profit educational organization
            founded by Sebastian Thrun, David Stavens, and Mike Sokolsky
            offering massive open online courses. According to Thrun, the origin
            of the name Udacity comes from the company's desire to be "audacious
            for you, the student". While it originally focused on offering
            university-style courses, it now focuses more on vocational courses
            for professionals.

          <h2>Nanodegree</h2>
          <p>
            In June 2014, Udacity and AT&T announced the "Nanodegree" program,
            designed to teach programming skills needed to qualify for an
            entry-level IT position at AT&T. The coursework is said to take less
            than a year to complete, and cost about US$200/month. AT&T said it
            will offer paid internships to some graduates of the program.“We
            can not turn you into a Nobel laureate,” Mr. Thrun said to a learner.
            “But what we can do is something like upskilling — you are a smart
            person, but the skills you have are inadequate for the current job
            market, or do not let you get the job you aspire to have. We can help
            you get those skills.” A cybersecurity nanodegree was announced at
            the RSA Conference in April 2018.

          <h2>Enrollment</h2>
          <p>
            Over the first several months of Udacity's existence, enrollment for
            each class was cut off on the due date of the first homework
            assignment, and the courses were re-offered each hexamester. Since
            August 2012, all courses have been "open enrollment"; students can
            enroll in one or more courses at any time after a course is
            launched. All course lectures and problem sets are available upon
            enrollment and can then be completed at the student's preferred
            pace.

          <h2>Certification</h2>
          <p>
            Udacity used to issue certificates of completion of individual
            courses, but since May 2014 has stopped offering free
            non-identity-verified certificates. In addition, beginning 24 August
            2012, through partnership with electronic testing company Pearson
            VUE, students of CS101 can elect to take an additional proctored
            75-minute final exam for a fee of $89 in an effort to allow Udacity
            classes to "count towards a credential that is recognized by
            employers" Further plans announced for certification options would
            include a "secured online examination" as a less expensive
            alternative to the in-person proctored exams.
